# EncryptMedi
EncryptMedi is a Hospital Management System which is designed to ensure secure and efficient management of hospital operations with distinct logins for admin and staff. The system emphasizes data security, employing encryption to safeguard sensitive patient information. Utilizing two robust encryption algorithms, monoalphabetic cipher and vernam cipher, the database stores all data in an encrypted form. Even the admin cannot access confidential patient reports, ensuring the utmost privacy. As we advance towards a more automated society, the significance of cryptography as a security mechanism continues to grow. With applications spanning across banking, shopping, inventory control, service delivery, information storage, and government functions, improved access control and data security methods are essential. Cryptography, as a vital tool, protects information from unauthorized access and secures communications. It is integral in various applications such as email, file sharing, and secure communications, making data difficult for eavesdroppers to decipher. The practice of data encryption, translating information into a coded form accessible only with the correct decryption key, enhances data integrity and customer trust. By implementing these cryptographic techniques, our system ensures secure, private, and trustworthy hospital management.
